## Project Description
In this project, you will work in groups and create your first software!
You are tasked with creating a **game** that interacts with the user, using the functions and basic python resources you have learned during the week. Your game will be able to take an input from the user and provide an output. 

You will also present your game to the class. 

## Games
You must come to an agreement with your colleagues so that each of you develops one of the following games:

* Strong Random Password Generator
* Guess The Number
* Hangman
* Message Encryption & Decryption
* Mastermind
* Tic Tac Toe
* Blackjack
* Soldier & Dice (Risk)
* Battleships
* Pokemon fight simulator

## Project Goals
During this project you will:
* Fork and manage your own git repository. 
* Plan your project.
* Build your own code from scratch. 
* Put into practice the basic Python concepts learned during the week.
* Get used to public presentations. 

## Requirements & Deliverables
The **mandatory** requirements that this project needs to satisfy are: 
* The project must be planned, using Jira. Remember that you **CAN'T CODE** until your project is planned. 
* Your repository must be clean and organized, which means that it must include a *.gitignore* file and a README file, as well as have a well-structured file organization.
