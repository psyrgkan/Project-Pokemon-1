Description of our game: describe the game we built in general words without too much detail about the coding :
            two playeres -> they pick pkm -> with randome moves -> make them fight until one of their HP is 0 so we have a winner

Challenges: - how define the classes of pkm and attacks and relating betweem both of them deepcopy
            - be able to choose the same pkm
            - how to acces the pkm name
            - the damage formula which take into account all the stats of the pkm and the attack bc if not the game was to short and direct.....
